**‘‘Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.’’** (From the Go website at golang.org )

Go was conceived in September 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, all at Google, and was announced in November 2009. The goals of the language and its accompanying tools were to be expressive, efficient in both compilation and execution, and effective
in writing reliable and robust programs.

Go is especially well suited for building infrastructure like networked servers, and tools and systems for programmers, but it is truly a general-purpose language and finds use in domains as diverse as graphics, mobile applications, and machine learning. It has become popular as a replacement for untyped scripting languages because it balances expressiveness with safety :
Go programs typically run faster than programs written in dynamic languages and suffer far fewer crashes due to unexpected type errors.
